# MurrePopMods

created 11 August 2021
but based on scripts and code written in 2015-2017
originally not set-up in a repo, not even as an R project, so some rejigging required

directory structure includes the usual (data, documents, figures, presentations, output), but all .gitignore(d) to manage file sizes

scripts are not yet linked to relative paths, so that needs to be adjusted
not a huge deal yet, as there is almost no data being read in these scripts, it's all basic vectors and a bunch of matrix algebra

Morten Frederiksen ammended the TBMU code slightly for the final paper, so need to get his latest version
